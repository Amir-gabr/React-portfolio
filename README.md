## About Me

I’m Amir, and I began my programming journey in November 2022. Despite the challenges of self-study, I’ve persisted and created this portfolio to showcase my skills and the projects I’ve completed. This landing page represents my growth and the technologies I've mastered. Thank you for visiting!
